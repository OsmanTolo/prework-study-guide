            All HTML elements can be considered as having a box wrapped around
            them. This box is known as the <em>Box Model</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The box model is made up of Content, Padding, Border and Margin.
          </li>
          <li>
            Margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an
            element. It creates space between the different elements (boxes) on
            the page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside
            an element.

            In CSS, selectors are patterns used to select the element(s) to be
            styled.
          </li>
          <li>A class selector selects all elements with that class name.</li>
          <li>An element selector selects all the elements of that tag.</li>
          <li>
