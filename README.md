# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This repository was created to store useful notes and resources for boot camp students going through the Prework. The notes will cover topics that spread across HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.

Given that the boot camp will cover complex topics and a large amount of resources within 16 weeks. This repo will act as a reference point and notes for keeping track of the majority of things learned throughtout.

The repository will be updated over time as different front-end web development topics are covered. Ultimately, the goal of the study guide is to be a quick reference point or cheat sheet to complement [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
